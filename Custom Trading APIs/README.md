# Custom Trading APIs

## About
---
 This is a Python-based library designed to provide trade execution interfaces, market data retrieval, and derivatives modeling capabilities. The APIs support seamless integration with specific brokers and data providers, with a focus on flexibility for the user. Each module is comprehensively documented, allowing for easy help() queries and providing detailed inline comments.

This project is particularly valuable for traders working with a variety of derivatives or currency spot markets who hold accounts with Oanda and TastyTrade. However, even if you use different services, the module implementations may still provide useful insights for your custom development needs. Your constructive feedback is always welcomeâ€”especially ideas for module expansion. Happy trading.
